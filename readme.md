# Array redesign experiment

This is a quick test to see what a std::array would look like if it
prevented out of bound accesses and would not use exceptions.

This code probably has bugs and is not implemented in an any sort of
efficient way. Feel free to play around with this repo but _don't_ use
it in any sort of production environment.
